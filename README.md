# healthTrace - Patient Monitoring System

healthTrace is a Java-based patient monitoring system developed using servlets, JSP, and JDBC. It facilitates communication between healthcare providers, patients, and administrators while efficiently managing patient health records, follow-ups, and secure communication channels.

## Key Features

### Patient Monitoring
- Real-time tracking of vital health metrics such as heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, etc.
- Historical data storage for trend analysis and long-term monitoring.

### Communication Platform
- Secure messaging system enabling doctors and patients to communicate about health concerns, appointments, and follow-ups.
- Facilitates timely communication and quick responses between stakeholders.

### Follow-Up Management
- Automated reminders for patients and doctors to ensure timely follow-up appointments, medication adherence, and necessary interventions.
- Centralized platform for scheduling and managing follow-up appointments.

### Admin Dashboard
- Comprehensive dashboard for administrators to manage user accounts, view system analytics, and generate reports.
- Customizable access controls and permissions to ensure data privacy and compliance with healthcare regulations.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Java Servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP), JDBC
- **Database**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or your preferred relational database
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Java Web Tokens (JWT), JSP Sessions
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket (optional)
- **Deployment**: Apache Tomcat or any Java Servlet container

## How it Works

healthTrace operates as a centralized platform where patients, doctors, and administrators can interact seamlessly. Here's how the system works:

1. **Registration and Authentication**:
   - Users (patients, doctors, administrators) register on the platform using their credentials.
   - Upon successful registration, users are authenticated and granted access to the system.

2. **Patient Monitoring**:
   - Health metrics of patients are continuously monitored and recorded in real-time.
   - Doctors have access to patients' health data and can provide timely interventions or recommendations based on the recorded metrics.

3. **Communication**:
   - Secure messaging enables doctors and patients to communicate regarding health concerns, appointments, and follow-ups.
   - This feature ensures efficient communication channels, fostering better patient care and management.

4. **Follow-Up Management**:
   - Automated reminders are sent to patients and doctors for upcoming follow-up appointments.
   - Administrators can oversee and manage follow-up appointments, ensuring continuity of care and adherence to treatment plans.

5. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - The admin dashboard provides administrators with insights into system usage, user management capabilities, and the ability to generate reports.
   - Administrators can monitor system health, user activity, and ensure compliance with regulatory standards.
