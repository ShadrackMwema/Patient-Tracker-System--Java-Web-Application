## 💡 How it Works

healthTrace operates as a centralized platform where patients, doctors, and administrators can interact seamlessly. Here's how the system works:

1. **Registration and Authentication**:
   - Users (patients, doctors, administrators) register on the platform using their credentials.
   - Upon successful registration, users are authenticated and granted access to the system.

2. **Patient Monitoring**:
   - Health metrics of patients are continuously monitored and recorded in real-time.
   - Doctors have access to patients' health data and can provide timely interventions or recommendations based on the recorded metrics.

3. **Communication**:
   - Secure messaging enables doctors and patients to communicate regarding health concerns, appointments, and follow-ups.
   - This feature ensures efficient communication channels, fostering better patient care and management.

4. **Follow-Up Management**:
   - Automated reminders are sent to patients and doctors for upcoming follow-up appointments.
   - Administrators can oversee and manage follow-up appointments, ensuring continuity of care and adherence to treatment plans.

5. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - The admin dashboard provides administrators with insights into system usage, user management capabilities, and the ability to generate reports.
   - Administrators can monitor system health, user activity, and ensure compliance with regulatory standards.
